<h1>Chic Estate</h1>

<h3>About the Project</h3>
<p>
A promotional email I designed and coded for a fictional E-commerce store called Chic Estate that sells Men's and Women's clothes. The goal of this promotional email is to help boost sales for the company for an exclusive offer summer sale. The email is responsive and works on all email clients. I used HTML, CSS, and Photoshop to create the email and Email on Acid to test it on different email clients.
